# hello-world
My first Repository using the hello world guide.

This is the first change I am making.

Currently my mind is in a very disturbed condition due to my loss of my job.

Now I am learning new skills to spend time. 

Git learning is also one of it.

Other than this I am fond of front wnd development.

I request anyone who can give me a freelance assignment, to contact me.
